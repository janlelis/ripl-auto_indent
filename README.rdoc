== Description
A {ripl}[http://github.com/cldwalker/ripl] plugin that indents your entered Ruby code.

== Install
Install the gem with

  gem install ripl-auto_indent

== Usage

Add the following line to your <tt>~/.riplrc</tt>

  require 'ripl/auto_indent'

== Configuration options

The plugin rewrites the last line (if the there are closing elements). If this is too buggy for you or your terminal does not support it, you can deactivate it with <tt>Ripl.config[:auto_indent_rewrite] = false</tt>.
You can change the default two spaces used for indention (per level) with <tt>Ripl.config[:auto_indent_space]</tt>.

== Known bugs

* Not 100% correct ;)
* Long lines might cause wrong rewriting (if activated)
